Description
----------------------------------------------------

As you know in Unity we can't modify animator properties as easily as transform properties which we can modify in the Inspector. 
So I’ve written this tool which can control animator properties in a simpler way.

Features: 

- Modify humanoid animation clips by simply dragging silders. 

- Add/Remove animator properties. 

- Body group and muscle name are copied from muscle setup window so you can easily understand what they are. 

- 'Mirror' button: You can control the values for both sides even if you change just one side, which is very useful when creating animations.
